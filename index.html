        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>The Yorker has always been an inspired group of innovative people, not afraid to try new things or to think differently. In 2006 we set out to do something that had never been done before in campus history and although much changed along the way, we succeeded - independently and online. In 2012 The Yorker passed it's first great test - with no one from the original team present, it continued to sustain.</p>
        <p>The Yorker today is different from what it was in 2006, but it's values remain the same. Each passing leadership is a testimony a culture that is not afraid to challenge the status quo. What will The Yorker be tomorrow? That's the most exciting thing.</p>

        <h2>Vision Statement of The Yorker, 2006 <small>(before Facebook was big)</small></h2>
        <p>The Yorker is the only student homepage for the University of York. It is the first website to show all campus and town events on any given week. Students can subscribe to societies, campus or going-out venues to view what's on, within their own customisable calendar.</p>
        <p>Packed with daily independent news, features and everything from student recipes to bar crawls, the Yorker is your ultimate home. Use our food and drink guide to browse through York's restaurants and bars, with leagues for the best rated. Don't know what to do? Check out our "to-do" lists from opera to paintballing.</p>
        <p>Our directory has all the addresses you need to get by and if you get bored, we even have a games zone. You can add any handy links you need, check out the weather, and update your "to do" list. What's more, 100% of Yorker proceeds go to charity, which means every time you click you're doing a little bit of good.</p>

        <h2>Snapshot of The Yorker, 2012</h2>
        <p>A shapshot of the website was taken at a point in time before The Yorker's second redesign in 2012. This includes videos and media from campus life at that time:</p>
